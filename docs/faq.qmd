**Q: The trainer stopped and hasn't progressed in several minutes.**

> A: Usually an issue with the GPUs communicating with each other. See the [NCCL doc](nccl.qmd)

**Q: Exitcode -9**

> A: This usually happens when you run out of system RAM.

**Q: Exitcode -7 while using deepspeed**

> A: Try upgrading deepspeed w: `pip install -U deepspeed`

**Q: AttributeError: 'DummyOptim' object has no attribute 'step'**

> A: You may be using deepspeed with single gpu. Please don't set `deepspeed:` in yaml or cli.

**Q: The codes is stuck on saving preprocessed datasets.**

> A: This is usually an issue with the GPU. This can be resolved by preprocessing on CPU only through setting the os environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`or `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1`. If you would like to preprocess on GPU and are running on the cloud, you can simply start a new machine instance which usually bypasses the issue.
